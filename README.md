# Non-Deterministic-Turing-Machine-Simulator

### Algorithms and Data Structure Project 2018 - BSc 


The program reads a .txt file as input, containing the specification to build a Non-Deterministic-Turing-Machine-Simulator (transitions, acceptance states, max num of computation), and the list of strings to evaluate. The simulator will give as output the result of the computation, that describes if the input string is accepted, refused or undefined.
The program respects computation limitation of time and memory.
